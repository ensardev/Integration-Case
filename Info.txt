For Distributed Server Integration operations, I added the "DistributedIntegrationService" service to the project. 
I set up a scenario where data records will be stored on Redis. Here, I established the Redis connection in the constructor.

In Program.cs, the service variable can be set between Single and Distributed Integration.

In the locking method used for distributed systems, the lock mechanism might not be released 
in cases where the application crashes or system errors occur. Here, the expiration time set 
for the lock mechanism is awaited. This can be a problem for long-term scenarios.
